<h3>Background</h3>

Abnormal user behaviours on e-commerce platforms can be detected in various ways. For example, if an item in a shop is a best seller but many of its orders come from the same buyer, we have a reason to suspect that the seller is conducting order brushing. 

Order Brushing is a technique that may be employed by sellers to create fake orders in order to inflate the seller’s or a particular item’s rating, which may likely push that seller’s items up the search results on Shopee. Therefore, in order for Shopee to maintain the integrity of their customers' online shopping experience, Shopee consistently monitors and flags any possible cases of order brushing on their platform.

<h3>Tasks</h3>

<ol>
<li>Identify all shops that are deemed to have conducted order brushing.
</li>
<li>For each shop that is identified to have conducted order brushing, identify the
buyers suspected to have conducted order brushing for that shop.
</li>
</ol>
